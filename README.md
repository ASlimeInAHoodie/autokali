# autokali
My repository of assorted scripts, tools, and other programs created from my passion for cyber security. Anything from CTF solvers to vulnerable applications - I'll be putting it all here.

Current projects:
- Several `/bin/bash` scripts for running popular tools for recon
- Other `/bin/bash` scripts for automating persistence and exfil on SSH machines
- CTF challenges

Adhoc tasks:
- Updating current scripts
- Solving git issues 
<!--and here is the first flag: FLAG{AUTOKALI}-->
